Calculating the availability of the US government.

# Start date
Nominally, the current US Government started on March 4, 1789. However, they didn't actually vote for another month due to lack of quorum (need an exact date). Also, they dubbed their first day of business as Dec 1 of that year. ([source](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics))

Washington's start date is also an important consideration, about 2 months after Congress started.

Do we consider this the first "shutdown"?
